# HANDOFF.md — session-to-session continuity

Not a decision log (that's `gavi411-brain.md`) and not a task index (that's
Jira / `gavi411-task-list-source.md`). This is the small, perishable stuff a
fresh chat needs so it doesn't re-derive or re-ask what THIS chat already
sorted out: in-flight state, uncommitted branches, open threads, anything
mid-thought when the session ended.

Overwritten each handoff, not appended — stale entries get replaced, not
accumulated. If something here turns out to matter long-term, promote it to
`gavi411-brain.md` or `CLAUDE.md` instead of leaving it here indefinitely.

## Where things stand

- **"Wrap it up" rewritten as an enforced checklist** (`CLAUDE.md`): the old
  prose version let steps silently drop — confirmed this happened to
  G411-11's Jira transition, which sat unmoved across multiple sessions
  even after the codeword was said twice. Replaced with an 8-step
  checklist ending in a mandatory ✓/✗ report line, so a skipped step is
  visible in the same turn instead of discovered later. This is a *process*
  fix only — nothing auto-runs; it still depends on the codeword being
  said and every step actually being executed correctly, same as before.
- **Aegis-spec.md finally read directly this session** (was cited but never
  opened before). Corrected a real misunderstanding: Jira's workflow has
  **five** states, not four — `Aegis-spec.md` §4.1 defines Open →
  Implementing → Reviewing → **Landed** → Reconciled. Landed = merged/live,
  not yet reconciled against acceptance criteria; Reconciled = acceptance
  formally re-checked against landed state (§5.5) — the true terminal
  "Done."
- **Live Jira workflow fixed to match the spec**: the board had a `Landed`
  column with 0 issues and no transitions into it. Gavi added the missing
  named transitions in Jira workflow settings and published: Open —Start
  Implementing→ Implementing —Move to Review→ Reviewing —Reviewing →
  Landed→ Landed —Landed → Reconciled→ Reconciled, plus a global "Any →"
  on all five statuses (including Landed, the one gap). Confirmed live via
  the Jira transitions API against G411-11.
- **G411-11 status re-verified, not re-decided**: still `Reconciled` (was
  already closed out in an earlier session, per this file's prior
  version — this session just re-confirmed it live rather than assuming).
  Checked routes/requests.js against the source backlog doc: it's still
  comment-stubbed, and correctly so — the real route logic belongs to
  G411-23 and G411-30..36 (separate `[You]` tasks, different Epic), not
  G411-11's scope. `CLAUDE.md`'s "Current state" section updated to say
  Reconciled instead of stale "in progress."
- **Branch/PR/review policy, ownership split, context-signal policy**: all
  still live as documented in `CLAUDE.md` — unchanged this session.
- Folder naming is **`server/`** and **`client/`** — `client/` scaffold
  landed per recent commits (572a423), not yet built out further.

## Open threads / nothing currently blocking

None — clean checkpoint. All doc edits this session are process/reference
corrections, not code changes; nothing uncommitted on the code side from
this session.

## Next on the spine

**G411-12 — React frontend setup (Vite, JS-only)** — `[Collab]`. Scaffold
already landed (commit 572a423, "Vite React scaffold for client/"); check
with Gavi how much of 12 is considered done vs. what's left before treating
it as in-progress or picking a new task. Per the "starting any Jira task"
rule in `CLAUDE.md`, state its Jira scope plainly before diving in.
